# Brain-Tumor-Detection
Detect brain abnormalities efficiently from MRI images using deep learning techniques with the VGG16 architecture. This project aids in early diagnosis and treatment planning for brain tumors, leveraging advanced neural network models for accurate and reliable results. The accompanying image dataset, sourced from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/denizkavi1/brain-tumor), contains samples of meningioma (type 1), glioma (type 2), and pituitary tumor (type 3) brain tumor types, facilitating comprehensive research and development in brain tumor classification and diagnosis.
